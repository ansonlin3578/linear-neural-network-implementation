1.requirement:
    numpy
    gzip
    matplotlib
    os
2.execute with the VScode
3.There are three .py file in the zip : (1)hw1.py (2)NN_layers.py (3)weights_check.py, they need to be in the same folder
4.Run "hw_1.py"
5."NN_layers.py" include full_connected, ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, softmax, cross_entropy layers, cotain forward and backward propagation
6."weights_check.py" is the file to load the weights_result.npy(trained), if you want to check
7.after running the "hw1.py", it will produce a ReLU.txt file to record information about eazh epoch
8.after running the "hw1.py", it will plot&save the .png file about accuracy and loss
